## STUDY BOT - Audio Captioning and Q/A Chatbot

## Value Proposition
Our proposed machine learning system aims to significantly enhance the learning experience for students by integrating ML models into existing EdTech platforms. The system comprises of two core components: (1) a speech-to-text model that transcribes lecture videos into textual content, and (2) a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot that enables students to ask specific questions about the lecture and receive accurate, context-aware responses. This end-to-end MLOps pipeline is designed to optimize time efficiency and improve content accessibility for students. 

### Contributors

<!-- Table of contributors and their roles. 
First row: define responsibilities that are shared by the team. 
Then, each row after that is: name of contributor, their role, and in the third column, 
you will link to their contributions. If your project involves multiple repos, you will 
link to their contributions in all repos here. -->

| Name                            | Responsible for | Link to their commits in this repo |

### System diagram

<!-- Overall digram of system. Doesn't need polish, does need to show all the pieces. 
Must include: all the hardware, all the containers/software platforms, all the models, 
all the data. -->

### Summary of outside materials

<!-- In a table, a row for each dataset, foundation model. 
Name of data/model, conditions under which it was created (ideally with links/references), 
conditions under which it may be used. -->

|              | How it was created | Conditions of use |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Data set 1   |                    |                   |
| Data set 2   |                    |                   |
| Base model 1 |                    |                   |
| etc          |                    |                   |


### Summary of infrastructure requirements

<!-- Itemize all your anticipated requirements: What (`m1.medium` VM, `gpu_mi100`), 
how much/when, justification. Include compute, floating IPs, persistent storage. 
The table below shows an example, it is not a recommendation. -->

| Requirement     | How many/when                                     | Justification |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `m1.medium` VMs | 3 for entire project duration                     | ...           |
| `gpu_mi100`     | 4 hour block twice a week                         |               |
| Floating IPs    | 1 for entire project duration, 1 for sporadic use |               |
| etc             |                                                   |               |

### Detailed design plan

<!-- In each section, you should describe (1) your strategy, (2) the relevant parts of the 
diagram, (3) justification for your strategy, (4) relate back to lecture material, 
(5) include specific numbers. -->

#### Model training and training platforms

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 4 and Unit 5 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Model serving and monitoring platforms

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 6 and Unit 7 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Data pipeline

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 8 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Continuous X

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 3 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->
